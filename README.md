Summer Heat Wave Mobile Alert System
Overview
The Summer Heat Wave Mobile Alert System is a predictive alert system designed to inform users of upcoming heat waves. This system uses data analysis and machine learning models to predict heat waves and sends alerts via SMS to registered users using the Twilio API. The project is aimed at helping people prepare and take precautions during extreme weather conditions, particularly in regions prone to high temperatures.

Features
Predictive Modeling: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to forecast heat waves based on historical weather data.
Data Collection: Automatically collects and updates weather data from reliable sources.
Mobile Alerts: Sends SMS alerts to users when a heat wave is predicted in their area.
User Registration: Allows users to register their phone numbers to receive alerts.
Web Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for managing alerts and viewing weather data.
Technologies Used
Python: For data analysis, machine learning, and backend development.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: For developing predictive models.
Flask: For creating the web interface and API endpoints.
Twilio API: For sending SMS alerts.
SQLite: For storing user data and alerts.
Heroku: For deploying the web application.
Installation
